# Video

Welcome to my Video project! This is a simple page that uses CSS grid to create responsive layouts. The page includes a header with a menu icon, a logo, and a title, as well as a section for playlists. The playlists include a list of my own playlist items and a section for playlists from friends, each with a user profile picture and name.

I hope you enjoy it!
